# hotel_booking_analysis

Project Summary

This project deals with questions like “when the best time of year to book a hotel room is?” Or “the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate”? What if the guests this wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset would help the said guests to explore those questions and help them find a suitable hotel to stay.
This analysis of data set contains booking information for a city hotel and resorts, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. 
The research concluded with the creation of data-points for guests to book suitable rooms for themselves by monitoring the trends. This data, being interactive improves the user experience and allows them to use this system as per their convenience. The background research aided in the formulation and validation of the problem statement and helped us create an information architecture.  
This study allowed us to acquire insight into the processes that are followed while creating a booking token. Overall, the research accomplished our goals of comprehending how the hotel systems work and how we could avail them at an appropriate price point with suitable amenities. The implementation of the system would help guests better understand the structure involved in booking hotels on a regular basis.
